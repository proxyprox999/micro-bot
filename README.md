so i made a standard ai it answers questions and everything but it can also do other things if you want bluetooth it has that its a really cool micro bot and after i typed all this it will be time for me to learn a few things about all the coding i did it gave me some time to look over it and think how i exactly pulled this off it is really hard i gotta give it that because of the python script so as with thst i had to open a whole new tab on my school laptop yes im doing this on my schools chromebook they are most likely mad because im failing in all my classes right now she is looking at me angry most likely going to suspend me but anyway i love typing and everything else but if i ever needed to i will go back to this and think why did i make such a ai? well.... its really fun!
